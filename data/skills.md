# Skills and Ability Checks (Summary)

When a character attempts something uncertain, the DM calls for an ability check. Skills represent common areas of expertise tied to abilities. For example:
- Athletics (Strength): climbing, jumping, swimming.
- Acrobatics (Dexterity): balancing, tumbling, staying on your feet.
- Stealth (Dexterity): avoiding notice, hiding.
- Perception (Wisdom): spotting, hearing, or otherwise detecting.
- Investigation (Intelligence): deducing clues and understanding mechanisms.

Checks are typically d20 + ability modifier (+ proficiency if proficient) against a DC set by the DM.
