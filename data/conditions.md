# Conditions (Summary)

Conditions are states that can affect creatures, imposing simple effects that alter actions and defenses. Typical conditions include blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, invisible, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious.

Example effects:
- Prone: attack rolls against you have advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet; otherwise they have disadvantage. Your own attack rolls have disadvantage while prone.
- Grappled: your speed becomes 0 and you canâ€™t benefit from any bonus to your speed. The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated or you are moved out of reach.
- Poisoned: you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
